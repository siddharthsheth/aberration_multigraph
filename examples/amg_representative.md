# Representative Graphs of AMGs

```python{cmd=true, id=setup, hide=true}
from aberration_multigraph.representative import AMGRepresentative
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

The **representative graph** encodes how aberration multigraphs (AMGs) are related under global operations such as chromosome-wide twists and swaps.

Each node corresponds to a distinct AMG, and edges represent a single elementary operation transforming one AMG into another.
Note that the operations performed here are different from the one explored in the paper.

## Constructing a Representative Graph

We begin by specifying the chromosome structure and DSB distribution.

```python{cmd=true, continue=setup, id=main}
amg_rep = AMGRepresentative(3, (1,1,1))
amg_rep.compute_amg_adjacency_list()
amg_rep.compute_representative_graph()
```

Internally, this:

* enumerates all AMGs for the given DSB distribution,
* computes all valid total twists and total swaps,
* records adjacency relations between AMGs.

## Visualizing the Graph

The representative graph can be visualized using a spring layout:

```python{cmd=true, continue=main, id=viz}
plt.figure()
amg_rep.draw_representative_graph()
plt.show()
```

Edge colors correspond to the type of operation (twist or swap) applied between AMGs.

## Interpretation

The representative graph provides a global view of the **space of AMGs modulo chromosome-level symmetries**:

* Connected components correspond to equivalence classes under twists and swaps.
* Graph structure reflects the redundancy and symmetry of rejoin configurations.
* The graph can be viewed as a Cayley-type graph generated by these operations.

## Remarks

* Construction requires full AMG enumeration and is therefore expensive.
* Visualization is intended for exploratory analysis and small instances.
* This tool is particularly useful for studying symmetry and equivalence among aberration multigraphs.
